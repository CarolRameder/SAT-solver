# SAT-solver
This project was a part of the Knowledge Representation course and was implemented using plain Python. The process starts from the sudoku game state and the sudoku rules represented in the Clausal Normal Form (CNF). The solution is obtained by searching the pruned backtracking tree with the DPLL algorithm.
